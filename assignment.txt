                Homework 4: Partial Redundancy Elimination

Course:     CS 380C: Advanced Compiler Techniques (Spring 2013)
Instructor: Keshav Pingali
Assigned:   Monday, March 4, 2013
Due:        Friday, March 8, 2013, 11:59 PM 

You can do this assignment in groups of two.

1. Objective
------------
The goal of this assignment is to perform Perform Partial Redundancy
Elimination (PRE).


2 Partial Redundancy Elimination (PRE)
--------------------------------------
At this point, you have performed two data-flow analyses, liveness and
dead code elimination. For this assignment, we will perform PRE. PRE will be invoked
similar to the optimizations performed in homework 3 (using command line
flag -opt=pre).

3. Output
---------
As usual, your compiler should accept 3-address code as input from stdin,
and write output to stdout.  Your compiler invoked by the script 'run.sh'
should accept the following command line arguments.
  1. -opt, a comma separated list of optimizations. The optimizations to
     support are dce and pre.
  2. -backend, the backend to be used to write output to. The optimizations
     to support are c, cfg and 3addr.

4. Turning in your assignment
-----------------------------
Download this tarball
   http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pingali/CS380C/2013/assignments/assignment4.tar.gz
This is organized similar to homeworks 2 and 3.

Your assignment should contain the following:
  1. A single tar.gz file named hw4.tar.gz, which, when extracted, creates
     directory hw4.
  2. The hw4 directory can contain sub-directories.
  3. The hw4 directory should contain the following files:
     a. README - Please include your name(s) and UTEID(s) here.
     b. compile.sh - a script to compile your source code.
     c. run.sh - a script that runs your compiler. This script should read
        3-address code as input from stdin and write output to stdout. The
        output is specified by the command line arguments described in
        section 3.
The hw4 directory already exists with these files in the tarball you
downloaded.

Turn in your assignment by running the following commands on a UTCS Linux
machine.
   $ # Go the parent directory of the hw4 directory.
   $ tar -zcvf hw4.tar.gz hw4
   $ turnin --submit olivo cs380c-hw4 hw4.tar.gz
   $ turnin --list olivo cs380c-hw4
Please use turnin to submit your assignment. Only homeworks that are turned
in using the procedure described above will be accepted.


5. Hints
--------
0. Start early :)
1. You may decide to work on your version or to ask the TA 
   for a "tested" version to build upon. In the latter case,
   no guarantees are made about the correctness or extensibility
   of the provided code.
